# Orbit-Propogator
Earth centric orbit propagation tool. Built from scratch in python.

Functionality includes:
 - tracking sattelite location over time
 - plotting sattelite ground tracks and path through 3D space
 - tracking the rotation of the Earth and location of the Sun
 - predicting sattelite eclipses
 - converting between orbital parameters and state vectors
 - converting between ECI, ECEF, and cartesian reference frames
 - converting between mean, eccentric, and true anomolies
 - calculating other orbit-related quantities
